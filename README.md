# ShapeCalculator

A simple library to quickly calculate the values of different shapes. This isn't meant to be exhaustive. Shapes, and their calculated values, will be added as I use them for things like `projecteuler.net` and `codingame.com`.

## Shapes 

| Shape           | In code        | Calculated values                                                      | 
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Circle          | `Circle`       | `Area`, `Perimeter` (used over circumference in code for extensibility) |
| Circular sector | `CircleSector` | `Area`,  `Perimeter` (used over circumference in code for extensibility) |
